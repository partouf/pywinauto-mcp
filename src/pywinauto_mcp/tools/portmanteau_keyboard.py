"""Keyboard input portmanteau tool for PyWinAuto MCP.

PORTMANTEAU PATTERN RATIONALE:
Instead of creating 4+ separate tools (one per keyboard operation), this tool consolidates related
keyboard input operations into a single interface. This design:
- Prevents tool explosion (4+ tools → 1 tool) while maintaining full functionality
- Improves discoverability by grouping related operations together
- Follows FastMCP 2.13+ best practices for feature-rich MCP servers

SUPPORTED OPERATIONS:
- type: Type text at current focus (supports special characters)
- press: Press a single key
- hotkey: Press key combination (e.g., Ctrl+C)
- hold: Hold a key down while performing other actions

SUPPORTED OPERATIONS:
- type: Performs sequential character input at the current keyboard focus.
- press: Executes a single key strike or repeated strikes of the same key.
- hotkey: Triggers complex key combinations (Ctrl+C, Alt+Tab, etc.).
- hold: Maintains a modifier key state while executing subsequent actions.

DIALOGIC RETURN PATTERN:
If the keyboard focus is ambiguous or the target application state changes during execution,
this tool returns a clarification_needed status with focus_metadata.

Examples:
    automation_keyboard("type", text="Hello World!")
    automation_keyboard("press", key="enter")
    automation_keyboard("hotkey", keys=["ctrl", "c"])

        PORTMANTEAU PATTERN RATIONALE:
        Consolidates all keyboard interaction methods into a single interface to prevent tool
        fragmentation while providing consistent input sequencing. Follows FastMCP 2.14.3
        standards for robust input management.

        SUPPORTED OPERATIONS:
        - type: Performs sequential character input at the current keyboard focus.
        - press: Executes a single key strike or repeated strikes of the same key.
        - hotkey: Triggers complex key combinations such as CTRL plus C or ALT plus TAB.
        - hold: Maintains a modifier key state while executing subsequent actions.

        DIALOGIC RETURN PATTERN:
        This tool implements the SOTA 2026 Dialogic Return Pattern for input validation.
        When an requested key sequence is ambiguous or potentially destructive, the tool
        transitions to a status of clarification_needed. The return payload includes
        detailed diagnostic_info regarding the current focus state and suggested alternative
        keys. AI agents must evaluate these recovery_options before re-attempting the input
        to ensure intended application behavior.

        USAGE AND RECOVERY:
        Standard execution requires an operation and relevant text or key parameters.
        In scenarios where keyboard focus is lost, use the returned focus_metadata to
        re-verify the target element before proceeding with retries. This maintains
        interaction integrity even during heavy system load.

        Args:
            operation (str, required): The keyboard action to perform.
            text (str | None): Plaintext string for sequential typing operations.
            key (str | None): Single key identifier for strike operations.
            keys (list[str] | None): Sequence of keys for complex hotkey combinations.
            interval (float): Delay between individual characters during typing.
            presses (int): Frequency of execution for the specified key strike.
            pause (float): Post-operation suspension duration to ensure input processing.

        Returns:
            dict[str, Any]: Operation-specific result dictionary with success status and input metadata.
